# -Practice-Lab-Neural-Networks-for-Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-Multiclass
This project is an implementation of a neural network model for handwritten digit recognition using the MNIST dataset.

Introduction
Handwritten digit recognition is a classic problem in the field of machine learning and computer vision. It involves the recognition of handwritten digits from images. This project focuses on implementing a neural network model to accurately classify handwritten digits into their respective categories.

Dependencies
Python (>=3.6)
NumPy
TensorFlow (>=2.0)
Matplotlib (for visualization, optional)
Model Architecture
The neural network model consists of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. Each layer is densely connected to the subsequent layer. The number of neurons in the input and output layers is determined by the dimensions of the input data and the number of classes, respectively.

The architecture of the model can be customized by modifying the parameters in the config.py file.

Training
The model is trained using the training set of the MNIST dataset. During training, the weights of the neural network are adjusted using gradient descent optimization to minimize the loss function.

Training hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and number of epochs can be configured in the config.py file.

Evaluation
After training, the model is evaluated using the test set of the MNIST dataset. The accuracy of the model is calculated based on its performance in correctly classifying the handwritten digits.

Softmax Function
The softmax function is a mathematical function that is commonly used in multiclass classification problems, particularly in neural networks. It is applied to the output layer of a neural network to convert raw scores (also known as logits) into probabilities. These probabilities represent the likelihood of each class being the correct classification.

Mathematically, the softmax function takes a vector of real-valued scores �z as input and outputs a probability distribution over multiple classes. Given �K classes, the softmax function is defined as follows:

Results
